::  Transaction ID - uuid string used for edit, del, query (not an ETH 0x...)

::  CoinGecko Coin ID - external ID that maps to a CG entity (e.g. BTC is 'bitcoin').
::  Used for querying CG API

::  Timestamp of transaction

::  Optional description of the TX
+$  note  @t
::  TX Amount in currency
::  Note usage of a string for storage; since no maths will be done in the app
::  (for now!), it is simpler for a noob like me to work with. Eventually this 
::  will be migrated to using an aura with numerical precision
+$  amount  @t
::  optional: cost per unit at the time of the TX (can be roughly auto-populated
::  with CoinGecko History API async, or manually entered by user... or if
::  imported from a CEX, use that value). see note re: string usage for amount,
